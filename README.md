# Gamifiedpersonalweb
A personal website that is like an 8 bit game, like the vibe of the one in Ready Player One.
It ended up becoming a website for with some fun games built into like some sort of virtual CV.

If i ever plan to use it for more than meeting new people and stuff then i will obv add to it and make it tons more professional but for introducing myself i think its great.

simple instructions is the in the opening game use the arrows and you should be able to just progress through the website from there.

Build/deploy instructions:
It is simple html css and js,
So you can fork or download the files from my repository.
And then either load the index.html from file or host on basic platform such as netlify or cloudflare.

It is also hosted on cloudflare pages to the url jamesos.pages.dev

This is for my second last midnight project in hackclub and hope all is good with it.
